# Anvil.js

This is the node script that runs my minecraft server on ```peticol.as```. The script execs the server jar and wraps stderr and stdin to script actions.

### Currently the server
* says a welcome message

### In the future I'd like to
* create an assasins game, reward players for killing other players assigned
* reward players with gold, diamond, weapons on correct kills
